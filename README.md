# learn-github
A simple, 'hello-world' repo to learn some github basics


## First thoughts
Repos aren't nessecarily private, so just be careful about that.
should be able to manage both branches and documentation, issues etc.

## Pull requests
Can pull requests get the extra change that someone makes to a branch? or are they locked to a particular (edit/revision)

## merge testing
when someone edits in the same place, what happens?
